Project Outline

Overview
My project will serve as a Platform for Book Enthusiasts.
Users will be able to login, write reviews for books, give it a score out of 5,
and have the ability to like or dislike reviews from other users.
Users will be able to search books by category and author.


Features
•	User login: Users will be able to log in, either by creating accounts in the system. If time allows, implement Google (Gmail) authentication for Login
•	Users will be able to write a review for a book (including a written portion and a score out of 5)
•	View reviews from other members and like or dislike them
•	See the NYTimes Best-selling Books


Technologies
•	Java
•	Spring Boot
•	MySQL
•	Thymeleaf/React (still undecided)

What I'll Have to Learn
I don’t have any experience building a website that requires authentication so I’ll need to learn that.
If time allows, I’ll need to learn how to do Google (gmail) authentication).

I’ll need to learn how to work with the New York Times API to display the best-selling book List
